Animal Clinic appointments.
Website looks excellent, very good & proffesional design!
Sticky transparent navbar does not look good when above page text.
Basic Vanilla javascript, dom manipulation.
You update information in the database successfully and thats very good !
On appointment button click we have an onclick in the html and an event listener in the main.js.
No point in having two functions tied to the same button in different ways.
Also the customer can choose any date he wants (what if the time slot is taken?) the button onclick alerts "Appointment Booked" regardless of the outcome of the booking.
I think this is an app with great potential and I encourage you to keep making it better !
Good work!
